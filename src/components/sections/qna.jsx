			<Question title="How long is the trial period?">
				It lasts for 14 days starting from the moment you signed up.
				Fibery is powerful and demands time to explore. So you need time
				to procrastinate, receive some reminders, get into Fibery again,
				and, finally, "get" it. We feel that you can do it in 14-days.
				If you'd like to have a fast learning curve, we really suggest
				to take advantage of our{" "}
				<Link className="underline">concierge support</Link>.
			</Question>
			<Question title="Can we access our workspace after the trial?">
				Yes, but in a read-only mode. Once you upgrade to a paid plan,
				you will be able to add and edit entities again.
			</Question>
			<Question title="Is there a free trial of Fibery AI? How much does it cost?">
				<p>
					Fibery AI integrates Fibery with GPT-3.5 OpenAI. You can try
					Fibery AI in text and space creation for free â€” and you have
					100 requests. Then you'll need to set up your OpenAI token â€”
					here is a quick guide to help you do it.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The cost will depend on the quantity of use, we estimate
					that it will cost you ~$2-4 per month per user with heavy
					usage. Note: if you use AI in Automations, you can spend
					more money in your OpenAI account way faster. ðŸ˜…
				</p>
			</Question>
			<Question title="What does the 'extra-caring' support mean?">
				We are happy to answer your emails and Intercom messages
				regardless of your pricing plan. Paid plans also include 1:1
				consulting over Zoom â€” if you are not sure how to organize your
				process in Fibery, we will figure it out together. We would also
				love to assist you with onboarding new team members.
			</Question>
			<Question title="What about this free 6 months for startups?">
				Get 6 months of Fibery for free if your company has fewer than
				30 employees.
				<br />
				Ditch those scattered spreadsheets â€” and letâ€™s grow together.{" "}

			</Question>
			<Question title="What happens if we invite/deactivate users when on a paid plan?">
				<p>
					When you invite a new user, we charge you proportionally to
					the time left in the billing cycle. For example, if you pay
					annually and there are six months left until the next
					payment, the prorated amount is $10*(6/12)*12=$60.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					When you deactivate a user, the unspent amount will be
					deducted from your next bill.
				</p>
			</Question>
			<Question title="What payment methods do you accept?">
				We accept all major credit cards. If you'd like to pay via a
				bank transfer, please contact us via Intercom â€” we will try to
				make it happen.
			</Question>
			<Question title="How do we pay for multiple workspaces?">
				If your organization owns several workspaces that share users,
				contact us via Intercom for a custom invoice. We don't want to
				charge you for the same users twice.
			</Question>
			<Question title="How is the payment being processed?">
				We use Braintree to process your payment. Braintree handles
				billions of dollars in transactions and is trusted by companies
				like Uber, Dropbox, and GitHub. We do not store or handle your
				credit card information directly.
			</Question>
			<Question title="Do you offer refunds?">
				We don't offer refunds, sorry.
			</Question>
			<Question title="Can we cancel our paid plan?">
				Sure, feel free to cancel your subscription at any time. All the
				benefits of the paid plan will remain till the end of your
				billing cycle. Once the billing cycle is over, we won't charge
				you again, and your workspace will switch into read-only mode.
